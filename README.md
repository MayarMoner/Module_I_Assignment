# Module_I_Assignment

This repository contains my solutions and practice files for Module 1 (Class 1b and 1c) of the AI_Omics Internship 2025.
The assignments focus on learning R programming basics, conditional statements, loops, data cleaning, and factor handling.
📝 Assignments
🔹 Class 1b

Created and set up first R project (module1).

Practiced saving scripts, setting working directory, and uploading to GitHub.

🔹 Class 1c

Task 1: Checked cholesterol level using if statement.

Task 2: Blood pressure check with if...else.

Task 3: Automated conversion of selected columns to factors using a for loop.

Task 4: Converted factor levels ("Yes"/"No") to numeric codes (1/0).

Verification: Compared original vs cleaned datasets with str().

Uploaded final scripts, cleaned data, and workspace to GitHub.
